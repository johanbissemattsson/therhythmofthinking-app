# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This work resonate a large number of voices other than my own. The range of their impact goes from practical guidance to more overall inspirational input, but they have all contributed to making the research into an enriching adventure.

More specifically I want to express my gratitude for inspiring, knowledgeable and patient guidance offered by my main supervisor Cecilia Lagerström. Her expertise has been complemented by critical and constructive input from supervisors Laura Cull, Gunilla Dahlberg, Gunnar D Hansson, Shannon Jackson, Trinh T Minh-ha, and Staffan Söderberg, and I thank you for your invaluable reflections.

Other readers who during the process have contributed with important input are Laura Louise Schultz, Johan Öberg, Camilla Damkjaer and Esa Kirkopelto, and I thank you for helping the process to move forward.

Continuous support and constructive criticism has been given to me by my colleague Lars Göran Karlsson, to whom I am deeply appreciative.

I want to thank Anders Carlsson and Anna Frisk for support and guidance through all the practicalities a research process entails.

To all the performers and collaborators who have invested their creative sensitivity in the making of the performances, I feel humbled and indebted. And to another group of inspiring individuals who in different ways contributed to this work, I send warm thanks to *Alice Collective for Sound & Stage Art*.

Invaluable expertise regarding the language has been given me by Dana Johnson and Joel Speerstra, for which I am very grateful. And, I want to thank Johan Bisse Mattsson for making the design.

Also, I want to thank: Niklas Billström, Tora von Platen, Susanne Osten, Filippa Hanzon, Anna Pettersson, Kjell Nordesson, Martin Åhlund, Helga Krook, Paulo D Assis, Shirley Johnson, SanSan Kwan, Eli Ingvarsson, Magnus Jacobsson, Margareta Petri, William Easton, Suzi Ersahin, Peter Söderberg, Kristian Berg and Henk Bergdorff.

Last but not least I want to express my deepest gratitude for the wonderful support that my wife, my daughters and extended family have continually offered.
