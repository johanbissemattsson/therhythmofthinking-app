## Entrance
I am aware that a deep sense of what actually happened throughout the different processes of creating the performances that I describe and use as references, cannot be truly attained through what I present here. The complexities of the many energies of the collective endeavor are concealed, not only in time passed but also within the inner process of each individual involved in the collaborations. But my claim that understanding or insights are unattainable is not done to infuse discouragement. Acknowledging this gap should instead be understood as a way to emphasize my intention to carve out thoughts and questions of a structural type, beyond the specific examples. The purpose of describing how the performance of *John and the Mushrooms* came about, was to chisel out a directorial thinking, a directorial practice rooted in a wider type of analysis, beyond hermeneutics, and to render the specific dynamics of an immanent creative process. Now, approaching the description of the performance of *vorschläge*, the main focus is still about the evolving of an immanent creative process and its effect on the dynamics of the collective creation, but the emphasis is somewhat shifted. If the field of tension, during the process of making *John and the Mushrooms*, was framed by the triad director – instruction – performer, the tension in the process of *vorschläge* derives from the relation between the author (composer) and the performer (musician). It highlights the sequence of exchange between instruction and performance. As a consequence, the role of the director is moved to the background, functioning mainly as initiator, and the different challenges that happen are mainly within the group of performers as they encounter the composition/instruction. This then can be said to place the author (composer) in the position of director. As the impact of my directorial position in such a conceptual set-up is reduced in regards to the shaping of the expression, I can well imagine that this might seem to indicate that my esthetic and emotional investment is less intense. Though, as we shall see, this is not the case, rather it is the contrary: the directorial engagement is reconfigured to describe what I refer to as *directing as participation*. Deeply embedded in that notion, in that shift of the role of the director, is the issue of hierarchy: an issue placed in the foreground both by the primary material on which the performance is based but also by my intention to problematize the relation between performer and director. This leads us to the questions we need to begin with: What are the specific reasons for including a description/analysis of this performance within a discussion on the discourse of an immanent creative process? What are the different ways in which the material – the musical composition *vorschläge* and the process of making the performance – relate to the overarching investigative questions of this work? And, how does the collective creative process in *vorschläge* differ from the processes of making the performance of *John and the Mushroom* and *Ryoanji – A Meeting?*

Six musicians come together to make music from a source – a textual instruction – that coerces a social exchange, which is then followed by a collective musical creation steered by their individual sensibilities. That is what makes up the sound art piece, what we hear: a primary material in the form of an instruction;<sup>95</sup> a social exchange in the form of a discussion; collaboration in the form of collective music making. Though, it is not what I anticipated. As I worked with the musicians in the studio, and during the editing process, my understanding of the piece radically changed. What had earlier been thought of as material open for interpretation and improvisation, I came to regard more as a platform for a process of group dynamics. My original idea to highlight the process of interpretation was not only complemented, but in part overshadowed by the complexity of the social exchange; a socio- metric pattern that exposed a group’s collective attempt at understanding, their desire to position themselves within the group, and their longing for inclusion.<sup>96</sup> It can therefore be said that *vorschläge*, both as process and performance, revealed a social aspect of collective creation, parallel to the level of performance, that permits us to look at the occurrence of an immanent creative process, of two rather different sorts: a group discussion, in a negotiating mode, evolving around the collective effort to interpret textual instructions from which music is meant to ensue; and the collective musical improvisation as an immanent creative process that escapes the control of its originator. Seen from the practice of a musician, regardless of which genre we are looking at, the process of interpretation is most often concealed behind a focus on the tactile aspect of the activity. As a result, the readiness to engage in an in-depth reflective discussion is not evident and cannot be regarded as central to the practice of a musician, in the same way as it is within a contemporary actor practice where continuous reflections on the material – the text, bodily positioning, relational aspects – are most often seen as a necessary tool for finding the expressive form. But if the musicians display a certain unfamiliarity when presented with a demand for deconstructive and analytical reflections, their engagement and participation in a collective musical creative process, even if containing sharp differences in individual expressions, does not cause a disjunctive energy. The tensions within the collective creative process – and therefore the flow of the immanent process – subsequently are different in *vorschläge* from those in *John and the Mushrooms*. In the later, the presence of a multilayered complexity with competing expressions raised the question of expressional hierarchy and the need for interpretive investment from the audience – choosing focus, inventing causality. The performative quality of *vorschläge* contains no such expressional tension in the music parts. This difference can be explained by the simple observation that multilayered musical expressions and multilayered phonetic expressions carry different potential in respect to being perceived as univocal. As a consequence, enhanced by the explicit intention of the composer to problematize the question of creative hierarchy, this description of the process of creating the performance of *vorschläge* will mainly revolve around the question of Who is the creator? thus placing the aspect of an immanent creative process somewhat in the background.

Related to the question of who the creator is, as well as to the question of hierarchy and to the issue of unpredictability, is the aspect of how the performance of *vorschläge* found its final form, and that needs to be briefly commented on. The discussions and the creation of the music were totally in the hands of the musicians. They created the material that was then edited by me.<sup>97</sup>  While doing the editing, I aimed to enhance the connection between their discussions and the instructions, but I also wanted to emphasize the phenomenom of translation and the confounding aspect of understanding semantic language, by alternating between a Swedish and a German voice. The fact that this performance was, on one level, out of my hands, but on another level quite significantly steered by me, might seem radically different from the other two performances, which is somewhat misleading. Yes, I did steer the framing and the formal aspects of the performance, but I did so in *John and the Mushrooms* and *Ryoanji – A Meeting* too, actually quite similarly, even if my influence was not placed in the same order, so to speak. The most significant difference between *vorschläge* and the other performances is that it does not unfold as a collectively shared unique performative event. The aspects of perception, multiplicity and co-composition are therefore less coherent, which is why those aspects are treated in conjunction with the performances of *John and the Mushrooms* and *Ryoanji – A Meeting*, and the aspect of creative hierarchy is the focus of this text.

The performers in the production *vorschläge* are musicians and not actors, and the expressive activity – as seen by themselves – is constituted by their musical improvisations and not their reasoning around how to go about doing just that. This clearly has to be weighed into the reasoning around the unfolding of the immanent energy and the performative situation. However, on the topic of musical improvisation there are a large number of reflective and analytical works that approach this activity, and most often these look at the improvisational process specific to the esthetic framework in which it takes place, its idiom.<sup>98</sup> I will not go into the specifics around the emergence of musical expression within free improvised music – which would be the closest definition of what the musicians engaged in when making the music in *vorschläge* – but instead try to give an account of the structural specifics of the process. Similar to the other descriptive texts, the underlying intention is to illuminate aspects of my thinking and practice as director and how that is displayed in the construction and treatment of the concept. But, as mentioned earlier, the position of the director in the process of making the performance of *vorschläge* is somewhat different since the main directorial influence - and statement – is embedded in the decision to activate the material rather then to shape it. The investigative questions grow from the material and do not derive from a directorial invention. Instead it is in the decision to include and expose the interpretative process within the performance that the directorial impact is fully revealed, thus assigning an expressive value to a stumbling, searching activity.

## From text to sound

When a musician is about to engage in playing orchestral or chamber music, the starting point is most often the reading of a musically notated instruction. Though, in some older types of music notation, used for example in baroque music, a musically notated instruction could be combined with a so called tablature, which can be briefly described as numbers written down in a specific order to indicate the structure and movement of the chords to be played, often as an accompaniment to a song or solo instruments. In other musical idioms the notated instructions look different, like when playing a jazz tune where a melody line can be defined through musical notation that is then combined with a specific cord progression written down with letters and numbers instead of musical notation. As a result of the rich and varied development of music that happened during late modernism, a large variety of music notation ensued, and the ways in which the composer specified his or her ideas that were to be communicated to the performer and result in sound production, brought about combinations of varied types of notation: conventional music notation combined with graphic notation, music notation combined with texts, images combined with text or numbers. But also pure graphic scores with no text, as well as pure text compositions.<sup>99</sup> The composition that functions as the ground material for the performance that this text is about – *vorschläge* (1993) by German composer Mathias Spahlinger - belongs to this last type: a musical composition in the form of a written text. Or rather, that is what it looks like at first glance. Through this rendering we will see that its inherent dynamics harbor the possibility of setting off much more than musical expressions.

To put Spahlinger’s composition in a more precise historical context, which is helpful when carving out its specific intention, we can place it next to two other influential musical compositions based on text instructions: John Cage’s *Theater Piece* from 1960 and Karlheinz Stockhausen’s *Aus den siebend Tagen from 1968.*<sup>100</sup> In *Theater Piece* – which Cage in his foreword labels “theatrical music” – the use of text can be said to function on two different levels.<sup>101</sup>  First, as notation: a textual instruction telling how to prepare and perform the piece, and secondly as source material to be performed. The score, which is created in eight versions, i.e. for eight different performers, consists of one1 page of written instructions, one transparent plastic sheet on which four4 different rulers are drawn, and six to eight pages with so-called time brackets where different numbers (1- to 20) are indicated. The written instructions and the transparent plastic sheet with the rulers are the same for all 8 players, but the rest of the score is different from player to player.<sup>102</sup> There are no specific sound sources indicated but instead each performer is instructed to come up with twenty nouns or verbs, each one to be written down on a separate card. Even if these words will result in movements, actions and sounds it is important to think of the language as functioning on two different levels. The instruction cannot be said to be directly connected to a conventional musical sound source, like an instrument – which it is in both the Stockhausen and the Spahlinger compositions – but instead creates a sequence of: text – text – activity. Cage’s instructions carry a quality of being both precise and flexible, and at some points contradictory, suggesting expansions or alternatives initiated by the performer. He clearly states that no conductor or director should be involved in the performance and the execution is heavily dependent on the creative responsibility of each performer. This latter aspect is, on a purely structural level, similar to the other two compositions, though, as we start looking at the Stockhausen piece the rendering of this responsibility takes on a slightly different tone, or maybe one should say demand. Stockhausen’s composition – with the subtitle *15 text compositions for intuitive music for variable instruments* – has no foreword describing the concept, nor an outline that defines rules of an overall type. But when reading through the short, poetry like instructions a distinct picture emerges of which kind of sensitivity and awareness the composer requires the musicians to activate. Throughout the 15 instructions, though all in different ways, the musicians are instructed to reach for feelings, to go inwards and to find a kind of non-activity, a place of no effort and no intention, from where they should begin to produce sounds. Formulations and words that reoccur are: vibrations of the universe, the inner vibrations of the body, shimmering fire, complete harmony, dedication, non-thinking. It is interesting to acknowledge that even though the possibilities for the performer, when using these instructions for creating music, can be said to be limitless, the sharp and demanding tone inherent in the instructions makes the image of the composer prevail, and there is a strong sense that something very specific is meant to be accomplished. This dynamic is almost opposite to the mode in *Theater Piece* by Cage and, as we shall see, this difference in dynamic is exposed, problematized and made use of in the Spahlinger composition.

*vorschläge* consists of twenty-eight short texts. The composer intended these texts to be read and used as a starting point and inspiration for musical improvisations, thus resulting in the same number of pieces of music. The language in these texts spans from concrete and detailed instructions, to a more illusive, poetic quality. Just like in Cage’s *Theater Piece* there is a foreword that precedes the actual instructions. One could say that Spahlinger uses a combination of the two compositional structures made by his forerunners. However, the meaning and effect of Spahlinger’s foreword is different from Cage’s, making it far more than a “simple” forward. In his, Spahlinger problematizes the relationship between composer and musician by questioning the hierarchy of the composer as decision-maker and the musician as executor. He raises the question of critical reading and emphasizes the importance of the musician to take responsibility for his/her relation to the instruction, and to the artistic expression. This should be seen as Spahlinger encouraging a kind of opposition, and a conscious shift of focus from the composer to the musician who is interpreting the piece.  This is what he writes:

>### propositions
*a concept to make the function of the composer fluid/redundant*

>*deliberation*<sup>103</sup>

>followed by the grace notes come the main notes. or rather: separation of main and side-thoughts, arguments, understanding and counterargument are omnipresent “temporary and develop gradually” (hölderlin), therefore transparent, exchangeable, determinable.

>these concepts would like to contribute to the collectivization of the once unilateral privilege to allow oneself (to have) an idea. during their evolvement i have let myself be guided by some deliberations that i would like to bring up with the intention to insert them into the discussion and thereby clarify that my suggestions not always satisfy my own demands. with this said an indication of in which direction i imagine that thoughts of this type can be developed, is made:
> those game-rules are the best (and also the most difficult to formulate) that already from the start are open, that demand or presume its own reflection, that comprise its own determination, its fluidity, its own abounding. game-rules for music – irrespectively if determined by the composer or if developed collaboratively from, or not from, a plan of some sort – should not be oriented towards result, should not be anything strict,  a commanding decree, but instead in each and every moment of its performance be at disposal. the rule should be influenceable, changeable, yes possible to eliminate, even when its validity is defined it should be possible to infringe; it will show that a determined infringement of the game-rules will bring more truth into the light than any rule will ever accomplish. or: other, not predetermined definitions of game-rules will ensue only by experimentation or ad-hoc decisions, that on the other hand – beneficiary to the entirety – is possible or desirable to disagree with and oppose to. what this music proposes, expresses, is, is decided by those who perform it, each and every one of them.

> decisions demands expertise. it is intended that they are possible to make on each stage of the development. the artistic competence is practiced and rehearsed before the discrete musical, the musical before the tactile, which always is restricted by relatively fixed regulations. in parentheses it should be said: the freedom of esthetic decisions should not be obstructed by social rules. this is about music. only when social processes instantaneously occur as sound, can they be allowed to appear in the foreground.

>pedagogy and didactics usually convey goals of study. and for the person who is inclined to communicate something it is infinitely difficult to avoid becoming a wise guy. that is the opposite of esthetic experience. i have tried to formulate only such concepts to which realization i myself want to contribute.

> the ancient greek word for school also means: calm and peace, untied time, (philosophical and knowledgeable) conversations; also slowness, lingering, idleness, dilatoriness. embedded in this lies both the demanding privilege of being detached from so called useful labor as well as the experience that those who educate themselves, think and play music most likely will reach their goal if they keep it out of sight.

> unintentionality, which this concept presumes, should not be confused with passiveness or fatalism: it has always been an artistic and intellectual virtue, and it should be a social. presently the chances do not seem large that the will, wishes and dreams of the individual, in a surveyable future, would become real and true. to reach a level of self reflection, as well as a critical relationship to one’s own will, without executing it, takes practice. let us calmly start with that, even though and just because of that it might be too late. we will see, as hölderlin said, that the most free is also the most intimate context.

> any selection of the “propositions” can be performed, in any sequence and in any combination, also simultaneously. some concepts can be part of others or incorporating others. any kind of variations and developments are welcome.

When juxtaposing Spahlinger’s foreword with the other two text-based compositions mentioned earlier, we can see how he might have been inspired by the openness and flexibility of Cage’s foreword to *Theater Piece*. But Spahlinger takes it a bit further as he emphasizes the creative responsibility that this openness demands, problematizing the relationship between the instruction and the decision process that the musician needs to engage in. If this observation can be interpreted as a critical extension of the meaning and energy in Cage’s foreword, the questioning and problematization of the hierarchical relationship between composer and performer can instead be seen as a criticism of the mode and energy purported in the Stockhausen piece. The demand for an individual creative responsibility is clearly present in all three compositions, but if Stockhausen implies a desire for unity and togetherness, a harmony constituted by simultaneous vibration, both Cage and Spahlinger oppose such a transcendent intention (force). Instead they expose a desire to reach anarchic harmony – a concept regularly used by Cage and adopted by Spahlinger.<sup>104</sup> The energy, or one could say socio-political intention, in the Spahlinger piece removes it from the atmosphere of the 1960s and places it in the dynamics of postmodernism by extending the criticism of hierarchical structures outside an institutional framework and deep into individual responsibilities in creative – and social – contexts. It is inevitable to acknowledge the central position that Spahlinger – implicitly as well as explicitly – gives the concept of freedom in relation to creative activity, and as we listen to the musicians we will understand the inherent potency in those poles.

## Six musicians dissolving the Author

When deciding how to activate and “direct” *vorschläge* my first idea was to create a sound art piece that would include both the source material and its interpretation. I imagined the compositional form (text instead of musical notation, as the starting point for a musical expression) would lend itself to create a perceptible sequence of how one expressional form is transformed into another, and by doing so create an exposition of the process of interpretation. The dramaturgical consequence of such an intention would mean that the source, the notation – in this case Spahlinger’s instructions – had to be included in the final expression of the performance. Such a concept would lead to a form with two audible components: first the text, followed by music. However, when reading the foreword I distinctly saw how it corresponded to - and infused useful material into - my intention to critically investigate the relation between the theater director and the performers. Its inclusion of hierarchical questions in creative collaborations and status relations within the norms of interpretation, made me anxious to somehow find a way to incorporate not only the result of the interpretative process – instruction followed by music making – but also the critical reading of and reactions to the instructions.  This would create a performance that would involve and include the complex and often invisible process of interpretation that necessarily precedes any performance. What is the musician’s understanding of and reaction to Spahlinger’s problematization of the relationship between the composer and the performer? And, how do they go about this? How do they think when turning the textual instructions into sounds on their instruments?  These questions made it clear that both a reading of the textual instructions and a description of the musicians’ process to make sense of them, should be included in the performance, as an explication of the process of interpretation but also as a metaphor for the continual act of examination in which we are all continuously engaged in. As a result of this idea, the formal concept of the performance was built on the sequence: *instruction – discussion – interpretation*. The instructions would be heard, the discussion would be heard and finally the music would be heard, as distinct parts of the sound art composition. This form was applied on each separate textual instruction creating what could be seen as movements.<sup>105</sup>

Six musicians were invited: Anna Lindal (violin), Torbjörn Helander (viola), Eva Lindal (violin), David Stackenäs (guitar), Åsa Åkerberg (cello) and Torbjörn Svedberg (percussion). Their educational background and line of musical experience is diverse. Torbjörn Helander works for the Royal Opera Orchestra of Stockholm and therefore is not very experienced in improvised music, although he has some experience of working with contemporary music. Anna Lindal and Eva Lindal both used to work in the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra but left those positions a few years ago to work as freelance musicians in a variety of genres ranging from free improvised music to contemporary and baroque music. Åsa Åkerberg has mainly been working with contemporary chamber music, which has given her insights into new and unorthodox musical thinking/notation and she is a member of Ensemble Reserche in Freiburg. David Stackenäs has mainly been involved in free improvised music with extended techniques and instrumental preparations as reoccurring expressional tools. Torbjörn Svedberg has a background in contemporary chamber music, and extensive experience as a theater musician. Together they represent a large variety of musical knowledge. Although some of them knew each other, this was an entirely new working constellation.

Before coming to the recording studio the musicians were asked to read the foreword, but not the actual instructions. The intention behind this was primarily to infuse an awareness of Spahlinger’s ideas about creative responsibility and to generate thoughts around the readiness to take an artistic stance. The decision to not present the actual instructions to the musicians beforehand was based on the idea that the interpretative process was something that should be done collectively, right from the start; I wanted them to move into the reading and understanding together, I wanted it to be a common effort. So, the instructions were presented to them one at the time, in the studio, with the directorial request that they should read it together and discuss it up to the point where it was possible to start making music. They did not need to agree on the meaning of the text or its consequences musically, but only on the fact that, for the moment, the discussion was over and that they should start making music.

In the following, the four movements – *cicadas, independent variables, empathy* and *birds* – are presented as text; first the instruction and then there is a transcript of the discussion among the musicians (when the instruction reoccurs in the dialogue it is called Voice of Proposition). At the end of each discussion there is a link to the sound file presenting the two text parts, followed by the musical interpretation. The sound files include components that are not described in the above, but instead will be explicated later in this text.<sup>106</sup>

>### cicadas
>what kind of noise, almost impossible to separate from musician to musician and still very similar, could, individually independent with respect to time of performance, duration and created by many, be aimed at building a sound with meditative effect?<sup>107</sup>

>how can a sound like that start and end convincingly?

>TORBJÖRN H

>Can it be convincing and meditative at the same time?

>ÅSA

>Yes, why not? Though, when I think about cicadas I don’t really think about anything meditative, because that can be a very strong sound.
DAVID
Well, I mean it can also be convincingly meditative, in some way.

>TORBJÖRN H
Yes!

> ANNA
> But isn’t it always difficult to know how things start and end convincingly. To start is always easier than to end something.

> DAVID
> There is one part here in the middle that I don’t know if I really understand. Eeeh, it says, What kind of noise …

>VOICE OF PROPOSITION
what kind of noise, almost impossible to separate from musician to musician and still very similar, could, individually independent with respect to time of performance, duration and created by many, be aimed at building a sound with meditative effect?

>ANNA
Maybe it is this, the sound that he refers to, that a sound is created and not … that one tries to create a sound together.

>DAVID
Yeees!

>TORBJÖRN S
A sound with meditative effect.

>TORBJÖRN H
What kind of noise builds a sound with meditative effect?

>VOICE OF PROPOSITION
Eine klangfleshe mit meditative werkung zu bilden.

>DAVID
And that could actually be any kind of noise …

>ANNA
Yes…

>DAVID
And that doesn’t have to be a cicada, as if one tries to imitate a cicada that could be …

>EVA
To me it sounds very contradictory, I mean if I look at the beginning and the end of the text, and if I think about a noise with meditative effect, it just sounds contradictory …

>ANNA
But isn’t everything that happens kind of very, … like any sound that just keeps sounding, that just continues and continues…doesn’t that create some kind of evenness, and that could be meditative. I mean, something meditative doesn’t have to be calm and soft. The fact that it is in perpetual motion … Isn’t that what we need to accomplish, a perpetual motion. Or?

>TORBJÖRN H
And how can something like that start and end convincingly?

>DAVID
But, do you think that this discussion should lead to that we decide what we are going to play, or … no.


>EVA
I just feel a real urge to try something.

>	They all laugh, except David

>DAVID
The goal for me is to, somehow … that we should find a kind of collective… that what I play doesn’t overtake in any way, I mean that I try to subordinate myself, and play something that doesn’t kind of go against too much …

>EVA
Because we probably have …

>DAVID
…what the others do.

>EVA
… six very different ideas about what we eventually are going to play, what kind of sound, music.

>VOICE OF PROPOSITION
almost impossible to separate from musician to musician and still very similar, could, individually independent with respect to time of performance, duration and created by many, … (Auch im Deutch … both languages simultaneously)

>### independent variables

>each player brings forth a sound, many sounds or combinations of sounds. The latter should not bear the typical characteristics for a motive or a theme, in other words do not use e.g. tones in a common scale and in a rhythmical regard do not establish an evenly metric structure, or at the least alter this immediately in the continuing lapse, or at least avoid having it in common with the other players.

>with regular or irregular recurrent insertions (each and everyone paying attention to good listening without fear of long pauses) everyone changes the sound or sounds very gradually but in regards to as many characteristics as possible, according to the principle: B is very similar to A, C is very similar to B etcetera, also N is very similar to M, but A can no longer be recognized in N.

>even extreme alternatives should be investigated (for the sake of the exercise and the experience): B is similar to A, but already in C A can no longer be recognized. this version is very difficult to produce spontaneously and probably less effective the more players that are involved.

>ANNA
Isn’t that kind of the theme, independent variables, it says a lot already.

>TORBJÖRN H
Hmm

>ANNA
Independent variables means “each one by herself,” the variations might happen depending on what one hears.

>TORBJÖRN H
Hmm

>ÅSA
In reality it’s maybe just to play.

>VOICE OF PROPOSITION
“B is very similar to A, C is very similar to B etcetera, also N is very similar to M, but A can no longer be recognized in N.”

>MUSIC Improvisation				

>DAVID
Shall we talk about what happened?

>TORBJÖRN H
I was just thinking about how we fall into making “music,” I mean, I was thinking that, and I think I said something about it earlier, maybe in our first discussion, that I feel like I want to join in when some of us play at the same time, then you want to be with, play together, I mean you have your own voice then too, but it is so easy to fall back into some usual way of making music together instead of keeping your own voice.

>ANNA
Usually we are disciplined. We are used to a lot of discipline, and it can be really nice to break with that too, to get carried away and just totally not give a damn about what he says.
They all laugh

>ÅSA
What was the musicianship in this, then?

>TORBJÖRN H
I wasn’t really thinking about that this time.

>DAVID
I think that … what I did in this version was that I chose to play … what I did was like a motif.

>TORBJÖRN H
Yes, exactly …

>ÅSA
Yes, but as you said, a motif can consist of so many different things so if you just play one tone it’s almost like a motif.

>DAVID
But maybe it is … it says: “typical characteristics for a motive or a theme”

>TORBJÖRN S
I was very caught up with this slow transformation, I mean what I did was kind of like a theme but I tried to change it the next time I played it, so to speak. Slowly. If there was anything that I was con-centrated on it was that: I wonder how my next phrase will change in relation to the one I just played?

>ÅSA
I created transformation by maybe keeping some ingredient.  Maybe keeping the ponticello but changing the note or … something like that. But, how did you make your transformations?

>ANNA
I just kind of moved the sound, a tone … like this.
Anna plays a chord with two tones, repeatedly, in different ways, with different timbre and changing one of the two notes slightly every time.
You know, very concretely moving the grip, very simple.

>TORBJÖRN H
It’s a little as if one should think the most extreme case, where one small ingredient is carried on into the next insertion and when that ingredient in turn disappears then everything is gone, erased, already forgotten. A is forgotten when you get to C.

>VOICE OF PROPOSITION
B is similar to A, but already in C, A can no longer be recognized.

>ÅSA
Exactly, maybe that was the version he played.

>TORBJÖRN H
I was thinking more like small, also …

>DAVID
Shall we play?

>TORBJÖRN S
Yes, let’s play one more time.

>EVA
Hmmm! Couldn’t we try something vocal?

>TORBJÖRN H
We can do that too, maybe.

>ANNA
Could that be an individual choice?

>TORBJÖRN S
Yes, it could be that.

>EVA
It actually says vocally or instrumentally, but …

>DAVID
Well, yes, or one can do as one chooses, then.

>### empathy
few players, individual sounds, rarely many at a time, long to very long pauses are possible.

>the first sound is brought forth with as little intention as possible (no acting or expressive self-assertion). the subsequent players try to determine from which intention, posture, state of mind, bodily tension, the sound has been brought forth by (this may be done consciously or not for the first player) and react accordingly: they search for a feeling of empathy within oneself, a way of playing that corresponds to what is heard and themselves, which means that they do not imitate but rather feel, changing and changed, at the same time each and everybody is free to select whom they react to, or if one wants to create a new beginning, which without every reaction could be interpreted as: every development is moreover an exposition.

>in every sound the demand ”place yourself in my situation” is concealed, which may be replied with “anything, anything but that.”

>during the first repetitions by way of introduction no key- or percussion instruments.

>do not seek to attain dramatic processes.

>ANNA
I react very negatively to this “ no acting or expressive self-assertion.”

>EVA
Hmmm

>ANNA
It kind of implicates that in some way, that musicians …

>DAVID
Oh, I see, what you mean.

>ANNA
…are self-assertive in their playing.

>EVA
That they kind of show off.

>ANNA
Or. The fact that it has to be addressed means that it is a problem.

>TORBJÖRN S
The sound is brought forth with as little intention as possible.

>ÅSA
Yes?

>TORBJÖRN S
For me, that’s a problem.

>VOICE OF PROPOSITION
der erste klang wird möglichst absichtlos erzeugt
the first sound is brought forth with as little intention as possible

>TORBJÖRN S
If there’s no intent with what I play, I just don’t play anything.

>TORBJÖRN H
No!

>DAVID
But intention can mean so many different things.

>EVA, ÅSA
Yes!

>ÅSA
But isn’t it more like a wish that one should start from a feeling or a mode, from inside?

>EVA
Hmm

>ÅSA
And you do something that mirrors that.

>DAVID
The intuitive.

>EVA
Hmm

>ÅSA
And not that one plans what to play, like if I do like this I sound angry
*She plays a loud and coarse tone very forcefully on the cello*
That sounded very angry. I don’t feel angry… so, that was kind of stupid.
But then also we should not imitate each other, like now she plays a glissando, so I’ll do that too. Instead try to understand the emotion Anna had when she played what she played.

>TORBJÖRN H
Yes, exactly, that’s how it is.

>ÅSA
And do, something.

>EVA
That is empathy.

>ÅSA
Respond more to the person than to the sound.

>TORBJÖRN H
Exactly.

>ÅSA
Or have I …

>TORBJÖRN S
No no, that is good.

>EVA
You know, it’s just not possible to kind of remove yourself when playing. Then that becomes an intention, that it should sound kind of dead or numb.

>DAVID
Hmm

>ÅSA
You mean that it becomes like acting?

>ANNA
He actually contradicts himself here, one thing, in the text, if it’s okay that I bring it up. He says that one should try to sense …

>VOICE OF PROPOSITION
 “…the subsequent players try to determine from which intention, posture, state of mind, bodily tension, the sound has been brought forth by (this may be done consciously or not for the first player) and react accordingly: they search for a feeling of sympathy within oneself…”

>ANNA
“ this may be consciously” I mean, if it is conscious there is an intention, right?

>DAVID
Maybe it’s formulated like that just so that we should react to it.

>EVA
The text is maybe written just to provoke us. But listen, hallo, we don’t go along with this!!

>TORBJÖRN S
I think about this “in every sound.”

>VOICE OF PROPOSITION
in every sound the demand “place yourself in my situation” is concealed, which may be replied with “anything, anything but that.”

>TORBJÖRN S
I should take in what you do, but I can also answer with something totally different. Or?

>EVA
Hmmm

>DAVID
It’s just like when we talk, now, I mean you can choose if you agree with me or if you think something contradictory.

>EVA
But isn’t it in this text that Spahlinger really tries to get this across, what he talks about in the foreword, that the composer is redundant?

>ÅSA
He wants to steer and control quite a lot anyway.

>EVA
Yes, but we are actually coming to the conclusion that no, we won’t subordinate ourselves to this.

>TORBJÖRN H
I feel a bit restricted with this “no acting, as little intention as possible or expressive self-assertion and no dramatic processes.”

>VOICE OF PROPOSITION
“no dramatic processes.”

>TORBJÖRN H
Without dramatic processes I would say one can hardly… is there music without dramatic processes?

>ANNA
Yes.

>DAVID
Hmm.

>ANNA
Yes, I do believe so.

>TORBJÖRN H
Okay, well of course, but then it’s more like what we did before, more like a meditative sound scape.

>DAVID
There is music that has other functions. Like in religious …

>TORBJÖRN H
Yes, tension and release in music, even if ever so little it … and then the form, to react on the previous, it becomes a dramatic process, though still quite undramatic.

>EVA
Hmm.

>ÅSA
Yes, that is a process, yes.

>TORBJÖRN H
I think that, eeh, to not seek any dramatic processes is the same as this non-intention, that I myself should not have any goal with what I create, I should not have a picture or idea where we are headed. It can maybe become quite expressive, large gestures anyway, but just that I should not plan ahead where we are going but that it is up to our collective unconscious.

>EVA
It might turn out like this discussion, that’s what will happen in the answers or interruptions, or whatever it will become.

>ANNA
Place yourself in my situation.

>VOICE OF PROPOSITION
 “they search for a feeling of empathy within oneself, a way of playing that corresponds to what is heard and themselves, which means that they do not imitate but rather feel, changing and changed, changing and changed.”

I just have to ask, this natur um rat…

An extended, deepening question.

>TORBJÖRN H
Yes, that’s it.

>DAVID
… in the outcome the result is, does maybe not become repetitive, in an anarchic piece.
I also think about this “expresses itself characteristically as stereotype,” if that means …

>VOICE OF PROPOSITION
each voice, vocal or instrumental, expresses itself characteristically as stereotype and/or have at one’s disposal a limited supply of alternatives

>DAVID
… if that means that it kind of should represent the traditional idiom of the instrument, or if it only means that this is what I choose to do. How do you interpret that?

>EVA, ANNA
Hmm

>TORBJÖRN H
Isn’t it like a bird for example that makes almost the same sound all the time, with a slight variation, it’s almost stereotypical.

>DAVID
Okay, it is only that …

>ANNA
Not the stereotypical way of playing the instrument.

>DAVID
Not like instrumental.

>TORBJÖRN S
No, I don’t know, I think more like you maybe decide a phrase that you decide to stick to…

But …

>TORBJÖRN S
… and that you in some way, with very slight variations.

>ANNA, EVA, TORBJÖRN H
Hmm, yes

Should we continuously try to imitate some bird?

Maybe it doesn’t have to be birds specifically, that is just some kind of …

Yes

But it is a bit risky with titles like that, you immediately get a strong picture of or you think birds, okay, twittering you know.

>TORBJÖRN S
What I read into this instruction is about repetition, limited number of variations, repetition, if there is something in repetition that can become musical, or create some kind of value for us.

>ANNA
Yes

>TORBJÖRN H
You know, it is left out … it says nothing about how we react to each other, now.

>ANNA
No, “unsusceptible to chosen points of insertion” that must mean …

>VOICE OF PROPOSITION

>ANNA
… that must mean that whenever you play it becomes a unique voice that repeats itself.

>	EVA
Hmm

>ANNA
The fact that you choose, that you limit yourself to some kind of phrase with very small variations it becomes unsusceptible to the surrounding, in other words it doesn’t matter when you play it.

>TORBJÖRN H
All these variations maybe adjust themselves from what we hear, from each other because we want to merge into a harmony.

>DAVID
Absolutely.

>TORBJÖRN H
And then it says anarchic, or anarchistic

>VOICE OF PROPOSITION
anarciches harmoni

>TORBJÖRN S
Anarchic

>EVA
Yes, okay …

>VOICE OF PROPOSITION
which characteristics must a statement of such nature have in order for the combined effect of the voices to reach “anarchic harmony,” a result that is unsusceptible to chosen points of insertion, repetitions, superimpositions and in which no individual voice nevertheless is extinct.

>TORBJÖRN H
But in a way that indicates that it’s supposed to occur by itself, because if it is anarchic we shouldn’t be influenced by each other, you should be totally stubborn, and stick to your stereotype.

>EVA
This then can’t become a dialogue in the same way as …

>TORBJÖRN H
No it’s the opposite …

>EVA
… the last experiment.

>TORBJÖRN H
… but the interesting thing here is if we should try to react to each other, if we should try to create this harmony or if we should counteract …

>ANNA
He asks which characteristics this statement must have. So, it cannot go on for like thirty seconds, that is too long, because if everybody, at the same time, made a statement that was thirty seconds long then would not each voice, the individual voice, be extinct, isn’t that so?

>DAVID
Why would a voice be extinct if you play for a very long time?

>ANNA
Isn’t there, no I mean isn’t there a, I mean if one chooses a statement, let’s say it’s a statement, if you make a very long statement, and everybody else makes that too then it would be impossible, there is kind of a time limit for what you can perceive as a statement.

>DAVID
Okay

>ANNA
Or?

>TORBJÖRN S
It maybe …

>ANNA
Just like when you talk, if I would just keep on talking and everybody else talks at the same time then maybe, if we just utter three words each, then maybe we would be able to hear all the words.

>DAVID
But at the same time, maybe a harmony can occur in that, in that mess of words.


>ANNA
But then it’s just a mess and the individual voice is extinct.

>DAVID
I am not so sure, maybe

>ANNA
It’s just something that I presume, that it’s something concise, something concise that is necessary.

>TORBJÖRN H
Maybe there can’t be huge differences in dynamics, maybe, then we’ll also …

>EVA
Yes, then your voice will be extinct.

>DAVID
Well, yes, maybe then, for me it makes sense, then the individual is extinct.

>TORBJÖRN S
I just think we need to listen to each other …

>ANNA
Once again

>TORBJÖRN S
… damned, we can’t get around that …
They all laugh

>DAVID
We can’t get through this.

>TORBJÖRN S
… because otherwise there is no reason to be here, if one doesn’t relate to the others.

>EVA
But don’t you think that you do that, kind of intuitively, as a musician, you can’t really turn that thing off, this listening to everything around you, even if you think “oh, here I am and I want to sound like this,” you are so incredibly conscious about …

>DAVID
This is about claiming your voice but not … you hear what’s going on around you, so in that sense I can’t avoid it anyhow, to take it in, on some level you get affected whatever.

>EVA
Yes!

>TORBJÖRN H
And this is actually totally contradictory to the last one, in that we really should relate to our inner movements and now we should stick to our own …

>ANNA
And still be included in the harmony.

>VOICE OF PROPOSITION
it is appropriate to ask “natur um rat” (hölderlin): is such a free and open result possible without repetitions? Can, should, is art allowed to thematize/obtain a pre-stabilzed harmony?

>ANNA
Hmm

>TORBJÖRN S
Right there, the image of the bird fits in quite well because they have their unique sound but it’s when put together with all the other birds, then it’s kind of like how suddenly the singing of birds occur.

>TORBJÖRN H
Yes, I think it’s interesting if we should react or if one should try to counteract this, to adjust in order to fit in or if one should be stubborn, stern.

>ÅSA
But can’t we be in variation, I mean it says here “have at one’s disposal a limited supply of alternatives,” maybe one can …

>TORBJÖRN S
Yes, right, what does that mean, limited, really, we should also be able to discuss that.

>ÅSA
Is that limited to one, then?

>EVA
Or limited to twenty.

>TORBJÖRN S
Though, still limited.

>EVA
Yes

>TORBJÖRN H
Okay, but I just wonder, should we decide that you, or, or that you actually think that you actually slowly are affected by what is happening. Or, what do you think?

>ANNA
Should we decide that or should we just see what happens …

>DAVID
We can keep it open, no?

Yeah, let it happen.

Somebody maybe chooses to stay, to stick.

Yes, then they will see how we are as persons, too.

## Layers of energy
As a slight contradiction to the observation made earlier, that in the making of the performance of *vorschläge* the role of the director was moved to the background, I would like to start untangling the different layers of energy that were at work by examining my own incentive to create this performance in the first place. To review that aspect certainly ties into the intention to illuminate my thinking and practice as director, but in a way that goes beyond the idea that the directorial impact is to be found in the building and/or treatment of conceptualization. The reason for this is that my position as an initiator corresponds to the position of the composer, a status that is seriously questioned by the material. This questioning of the position of the composer/director as an uncontested ruler carries, in my opinion, the desirable opportunity to remove the director away from having a direct influence on the forming of the expression (even more so than in the performance of *John and the Mushrooms* where that only happened in specific parts). In *vorschläge*, very little could be changed, no intervention could be made. The influence of my directorial judgment was eliminated and the possibility of interfering was confined to the editing process, i.e. putting the different parts together. As a director, why would I view this as desirable? That question should be included and asked in regards to all three of the performances we are looking at, since all of them, in various ways, are constructed so that the expressive movements evade the influence of the director.

It is the inconceivable possibilities of the unpredictable that are desirable, and hence constitute the main reason for enabling its occurrence within the expressive form.  Embedded in the unpredictable are energies and openings that in different ways effect the directorial position. The most obvious is that the unpredictable presents solutions and alternatives beyond the limits of my own imagination. Something that has not occurred in me before, expressive forms that I have not been able to imagine, transpire, and the restraints of my capacity are loosened. However, what is desirable in that does not (only) have to do with the sense of tedium one can meet in the face of one’s own decisions but rather that it harbors an opening towards inclusion: As the expressive movements emerge anew it enables me to feel more like I am participating in the expressive progression. My curiosity around what can happen, and the differences that can emerge, makes me feel more engaged (happy, worried, surprised) and I move along with a sense, even though not concretely contributing, that I participate in the unfolding of the event. This is what I call *directing as participation.*<sup>108</sup>

The collaborative situation in *vorschläge* consists of a number of elements and factors that steer the creative activities in ways that are more or less contradictory, thus creating tensions. A directorial stance characterized by observation and listening rather than infusing suggestions does not eliminate an influence but instead exerts demands of a formal kind (for example, the directorial instruction to the musicians to discuss the instructions). The performers are influenced by, on some level dependent on, the director’s presence since it constitutes the structural foundation for what they are doing. In other words, the lack of influence on the expressive outcome does not equal a non-presence, just like the invitation in the foreword to neglect the instructions formulated by the composer does not eliminate his influence. They both represent forces within the creative activity and most obviously are geared towards producing an outcome of an expressive kind. The ensemble does not contest this since all the energies move towards making – something – whatever we want to call it. Here the tensions, the questionings and provocations, are all dependent on each other and circumscribed by the parameters of the situation. However, the elimination of any of these – the composition, the director, the musicians - would not eliminate the problem(atization) that the composition, at its core, intends to highlight but rather creates a shift, a change of “stage.” How is that? Well, the composition is not an invention in a socio-metric sense. Sociometry as phenomena is always present in groups of humans (and animals) and the situation that ensues from engaging in the composition could be said to “just” move the dynamics of elements and energies that already prevail outside the performative event (the realm of the composition), into a mold with an artistic format – a composition. To create such concentrated and artistically aimed representations of sociometric patterns is one strain in the work of Spahlinger. A more recent, as well as a more contested example than vorschläge, is his large orchestral composition *dobbelt bejaht*, which was presented at the Donaueschinger Musiktage in Germany in 2009. In this composition each musician in the orchestra is responsible for making individual choices during the course of the performance. Through the specific demands that the composition entails, and Spahlinger’s theorization around it, the question of hierarchy is merged with a more explicit political discussion by placing it in relation to concepts like freedom, responsibility and “means of production,” all of which connect to a Marxist critical apparatus. In his description of this composition and the rendition of the performance, as well as of the critical discussion that followed, Jef Chippewa writes about how Spahlinger’s ideas “converge in a particularly effective constellation for their exploration and presentation” (Chippewa 2012, 21), thus indicating the connection to earlier work like vorschläge. In his opening section Chippewa formulates the core problem that ensued from the production of *dobbelt bejaht*: “The work polarized composers, performers and public alike, and polemic discussions ensued, not because of the four-hour duration of the work, not because of concerns about the effectiveness or musical interest of the concepts explored in the work’s 24 individual pieces, not because of the ‘open form’ of the individual pieces, not even because the piece was to be performed without a conductor. The central point of contention in the discussions was in fact about whether the orchestral musician can be, wants to be, or even should be ‘liberated,’ an issue which arose from Spahlinger’s use of the term entfremdete Arbeit [alienated labor], a concept elucidated by Marx explaining the division of labor in industrialized society, in relation to the structure of the orchestra” (Chippewa 2012, 21). The hierarchical situation and the cultural/historical connotations that the symphony orchestra as a format for collective music making are bound by, differ quite a bit from the chamber music format that the performance of vorschläge represents. However, the components and challenges are very much the same, seen from the perspective of the performer. The composition presents a problem that has to be solved in order for the composition to come into being: “Each individual piece can be considered a musical problem which the musicians are confronted with and examine, scrutinize and try to resolve as they play the piece, with the expectation that they will find a solution that is appropriate in conceptual, musical and socio-political terms to the nature of the problem” (Chippewa 2012, 23). The readiness to take on this task to make music from an instruction that needs to be “converted” through an individual decision is what *dobbelt bejaht* – as well as *vorshläge* – are attempting to challenge. The question is then, is this met with a sense of freedom or with a sense of fear? In the framework of the symphony orchestra and its “existing protocol of sociopolitical organization”, Spahlinger implicitly makes the assumption that the individual musician carries a double picture of him/her self; partly as an autonomous creative individual and partly as a worker who is the means to the production of an object that does not belong to him or her and which he/she has no role in designing. (Chippewa 2012, 24) It is the embracing of this latter part of the self-image that becomes an obstacle when facing the task to make individual decisions. However, it would be a mistake to tie this field of friction – the creator vs. the worker – to something that solely operates on an individual level. Instead it is deeply rooted in the history of hierarchy and power structures that have prevailed, and still do, in institutional culture production. In the field of music, and most clearly so in the framework of a symphony orchestra, the hierarchical construct places the composer at the top, the musician at the bottom and the conductor in between. In his composition *dobbelt bejaht* Spanglinger omits the conductor: the piece, large and complex as it is, should be performed without a conductor. As a consequence, the composition problematizes the individual capacity *and* the question of collaboration, hence does not really question the composer and the composition. In *vorschläge* on the other hand, it is the status and influence of the composer that is questioned and the poles of tension are constituted by the instruction, given by the composer, and the performer. What Spahlinger sets in motion, or you could say what he creates a platform for, in both these compositions, is a radical questioning of prevailing hierarchical structures in collaborative creation and a plea for creative emancipation. But if *dobbelt bejaht* can be said to present solely musical problems to be solved, the concept of the performance of *vorschläge* adds another level to that challenge by demanding the musicians to engage in a reflective discussion aimed at solving not only musical “problems” but also problems of hierarchy. From a directorial point of view this difference is of crucial importance: If Spalinger created *dobbelt bejaht* in order to make the esthetic implications of a specific means of production audible through the interpretation of the *music*, in *vorschläge* it is not the music but the *discussions* between the musicians that make the socio-hierarchical implications of a specific means of production perceptible.

## The playing out

How did these different layers of energy play out when making the performance of *vorschläge*? Were the musicians fearful of the creative freedom given to them? Were they hesitant to take responsibility for their creative decisions? How did the collaboration evolve? And, how can we detect the immanent energy in the different movements of expression? Clearly, when listening to the performance we understand that some of the areas of tension exposed in the above reasoning reverberate more than others, and some just do not seem to exist at all. Most likely this is due to the fact that the musicians are experienced in making music that depends on their ability to carry out individual esthetic choices, for example related to “the freedom of interpretation and decision-making responsibility that we have long come to expect from a string quartet performance,” but also from their experience of musical formats like different idioms of improvised music (Chippewa 2012, 23). Consequently, the fear of making individual creative musical decisions was not an issue. Instead the overall energy in the ensemble can be exemplified by the violinist Eva saying “I just feel a real urge to try something,” or by the guitarist David who at one point cuts the discussion short by saying “Shall we play?” This, on the other hand, can be interpreted as an anxiousness to move beyond the discussions, beyond the demands of reflection and as a sign of being uncomfortable with the talking, hence opening up for the question if the playing of music and the readiness to engage in talking were two areas that were sensed as offering different levels of freedom and responsibility? Certainly all members of the ensemble were far more fluent making music then talking about the process of making it, but their willingness to discuss the instructions was there from the start even though, as we can hear, some of the musicians were more engaged in certain discussions and some in others.<sup>109</sup>  A reoccurring figure in the exchange, that contradicts the notion that the musicians wanted to move ahead and “just play,” is their turning back to the instructions and their scrutiny of the details, as they try to find an understanding of the textual interplay between a sometimes sharp and instructive tone, and a tone of poetic vagueness. This concern to understand and their sense of being responsible for what is expressed, is exemplified by the percussion player Torbjörn Svedberg’s reaction to one of the instructions that demands that the sound is brought forward “with as little intention as possible” *(empathy)* saying: “For me that’s a problem. If there’s no intent with what I play, I just don’t play anything.” Such a statement indicates the willingness, almost a need, to obtain the authorship of the expression, and this was an attitude that signified the overall mode in the ensemble during the work. On the one hand, the thoroughness of such an attitude can be traced back to a level of tactility and the basic demands laid upon the musician, encountering any composition, that in order to produce a sound from the score the reading has to be precise. But in the context of *vorschläge*, and certainly enhanced by the problematization offered in the foreword, it should be understood as a force aimed to counteract the influence of the composer. Though not explicitly formulated, the general sense was that the ensemble came together as one authority against the authority of the composer. We hear almost no contentions within the ensemble, instead the only heated outburst was directed towards the composer when the cello player Åsa Åkerberg says that “He [the composer] wants to steer and control quite a lot anyway.” and Eva Lindal continues by saying “Yes, but we are actually coming to the conclusion that no, we won’t subordinate ourselves to this.” Without negotiating with the other musicians Eva uses the pronoun *we*, indicating that she has a sense that they, the ensemble, are united (against the composer). We can conclude that the intent of the composition to instigate opposition against its position as an all mighty ruler has successfully played out.

## Immanence in dialogue, immanence in music making

In search for what could be described as an immanent creative process in the making of *vorschläge*, we have to look at it as occurring on two levels, with different dynamics going on within the collective creation: the level of the movements in the discussions and the level of the music making. Is it really necessary to separate them? Yes, and no. As outlined previously an immanent energy within a collective creative situation is signified by how the creative expression is set in motion through the initiative and judgment of the individual performers involved, and this in turn is influenced by the stimuli that is perceived by each performer. I also suggested that the immanent process is immanent because the development of the collective expression is not decided or rehearsed, it emanates from within the collective process as a sequence that involves impulse, reaction, response. From this it is possible to conclude that if we regard the discussions, preceding the music making in *vorschläge*, as a creative expression, no such separation is needed. On the other hand, if we want to chisel out anything of interest in regards to creative interaction, it is fruitful to look at the two levels as representing immanent creative processes of different nature and with different components.

Beyond the fact that the ensemble comes together because they are asked to do so, the instructions formulated by the composer exert a significant transcendent force in the evolvement of the discussions. The observation made earlier that the musicians repeatedly refer to the instruction text as a kind of compass, can also be seen as a need to gain impetus from a source outside the movements within the ensemble, i.e. an input of a transcendent character. The access to a fluent verbal expression (practice/habit/flow) is not obvious but what might be heard as hesitation or lack of creative impulses can also be heard as spaces of thinking and listening. In those spaces the immanent process moves, yet in a less expressive way. As a sign, or one could say as an expressive outcome, the guttural sounds made by the performers become a part of the talking-thinking weave. These sounds can be seen as spurts of energy inserted to feed the immanent movement, perhaps as signs confirming the we-mode and a wish for commonality. In the performance they are placed as introductions to each movement, pulled out and isolated from the rest of the dialog. To look at the discussions between the musicians through the concept of an immanent creative process is, as we can see, a somewhat strained venture. The dynamic is less about collective building of an expression and more about collective understanding, less about collaboration and more about participating in the emergence of a sociometric pattern with as few conflicts as possible. In that process, it is obvious that the members of the ensemble feel a  high level of concern for the idea that the discussion is a joint effort towards making something together, and in that effort they avoid conflicts, choosing not to nourish discrepancies in their understanding of the instructions. It is possible to detect a resemblance between this dynamic (listening, rhythm) and the one they use in the next step, the music making.

The music that is created is free improvisations in a non-idiomatic mode. Or rather, that is how musicologists refer to it, since it does not use structures established in idioms where improvisation is a major part, as for example in different kinds of folk music or jazz.  However, there is an unspoken but shared understanding within the ensemble as to which musical idiom the improvisations belong to. This understanding derives partly from formulations and concepts given by Spahlinger in the instructions – like the production of sound structures (rather than tones or keys), *superimpositions*, no *common scales*, no *evenly metric structure*, *extreme alternatives* – all markers of an esthetics with roots in late modernism (and early post-modernism) where tonality is in flux, sound structures replace tonal structures and evenly metric structures are dissolved through the use of multilayered rhythmic formations. So, one could say that Spahlinger guides the musicians into a specific musical language. But this can only happen if there is some kind of pre-knowledge and experience from playing and listening to a wide variety of contemporary music. The unfolding of the immanent creative process must therefore be seen in light of this idiomatic delineation and understanding: its energy and character is influenced and shaped by a tacit knowledge of musical idioms. Nevertheless, in the actual music making the evolvement of the expression does not grow from a conceptual agreement preceding the present moment of the improvisation. Rather, the collectively created music – emerging as a sequence of: activity, listening, adjustment/judgment, activity – is to a large degree steered by listening. This is also acknowledged by the members and commented on by the percussion player Torbjörn Svedberg: “I just think we need to listen to each other because otherwise there is no reason to be here, if one doesn’t relate to the others.” And the violinist Eva Lindal answering: “But don’t you think that you do that, kind of intuitively, as a musician, you can’t really turn that thing off, you listen to everything around you, even if you think ‘oh, here I am and I want to sound like this’, you are so incredibly conscious about.” Through the interpretive sequence – reading and scrutinizing the instruction, weighing the dynamics and characteristics of the expressive activity, listening and adjusting – there is a high level of discipline, and this notion of carefulness and precision is interesting to acknowledge (actually in relation to all three performances) as it is the exact opposite of the popular perception of how art making based on chance, indeterminacy and improvisation, is made. Petr Kotik comments on this in relation to some compositions by Cage when he says that it is “the discipline, the exactness, the precision, the focus, the concentration” that is needed, because without that “the application of chance turns the music into nonsense” (Kotik 1993, 25–6). In defining the characteristics of the mode in which the immanent creative process is happening in the musical improvisations in *vorschläge*, we slowly see that there are a number of different aspects that rule how it unfolds, ranging from the transcendent force of the instructions, through the idiomatic mode implicitly understood and applied by the performers, and the discipline inherent in the musical practice (education, experience) of the musicians. All this put together makes for an expressive outcome that differs in temperament from the immanent creative processes produced in *John and the Mushrooms* and also in *Ryoanji – A Meeting*. The individual expressions are less disparate, contradictions less apparent, the friction between competing expressive qualities less harsh. The combined expression does not generate a need for the listener/audience to choose one perspective in the process of perception, or rather the need to dismiss certain expressive elements, in the same way that the multilayered structures of the other two performances demanded. There is a consolidation happening regardless of which type of investment the audience/listener applies. This is partly a result of the expressive material – that it is musical sounds and not spoken language or body movements – but also because the improvisation ensues from one and the same primary material, the same instruction. The interesting – and important – explication of that observation is that the expression finds its consolidation not only depending on the nature of the primary material but on the nature of the consistency of the expressive parts.

Initially the incentive to create a performance based on Spahlinger’s composition came from a curiosity to investigate the question of interpretation and the type of thinking and creative effort a musician must engage in when transforming a pure text instruction to musical sound. But my understanding of the composition changed as the performance took form – actually underwent a shift that goes beyond the notion of “a deepened understanding” – and therefore it is possible to say that the directorial position was moved by an immanent energy, impossible not to follow. The dynamics that were conjured up by the exposition of the material could not be ignored or overrun, instead the directorial gaze had to change. Conclusively, the performance of *vorschläge* is, just like the other two, firmly grounded in its own concrete circumstances, limitations and problems, and I can only speculate that this description will find its place and reverberate interestingly when placed next to the critical exploration and dramaturgical reasoning offered in the essays that surround it.
